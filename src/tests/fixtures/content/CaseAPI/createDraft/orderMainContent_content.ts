  joint: `(Where parties should liaise for medical evidence progression)
This appeal file has been referred to me for directions.
I have read the appeal papers including the available medical evidence and have decided that further expert medical evidence is required to enable the tribunal to properly consider the application. In the circumstances it is reasonable for the CICA to meet the cost of obtaining a report from a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist.
I remind the parties that they have a duty to cooperate with the tribunal and to avoid any unnecessary delay.
Directions
1. The CICA and Mr/Mrs …..shall liaise together to make any necessary and reasonable adjustments to the respondent’s standard letter of instruction.
2. I expect the parties to be able to adjust the letter of instruction and to obtain all of the documents, records and other evidence which the instructed expert requires to examine promptly and without specific direction from the tribunal but in the event that they are unable to agree either party may return to the tribunal for specific directions.
3.I expect that a promptly instructed expert will be able to prepare a report within 4 months from the date of issue of this notice and I direct the respondent to send a copy of the report to the tribunal immediately on receipt.
4. I direct the clerk to re-refer this file to me for further directions immediately on receipt of the expert report and in any event after 4 months.`,
